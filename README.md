Been on hiatus from open source due to draconian corporate intellectual property policies, and not wanting to expose communities I care about to undue legal risk while bound by them.

I hope to return soon! Actively seeking alternate employment without such restrictions, allowing full return to unrestrained engagement with the open source communities I love and yearn to return to.
